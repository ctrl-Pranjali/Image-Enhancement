# **Image-Enhancement**

In this project, I have developed techniques to **enhance dark or low light images**. The primary goal is to improve the visibility and quality of images captured in poor lighting conditions. This repository contains the code, algorithms, and documentation for various image enhancement methods implemented during the project.

## **Features**
- **Image Brightening:** Adjusts the brightness levels to make dark images more visible.
- **Contrast Enhancement:** Improves the contrast to bring out details in low-light images.
- **Noise Reduction:** Reduces noise that often accompanies low-light photography.
- **Color Correction:** Corrects the color balance to ensure natural and accurate colors.
- **Histogram Equalization:** Uses histogram equalization techniques to enhance the overall appearance of images.
